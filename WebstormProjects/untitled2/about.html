            <h2>My Journey and Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                Nice to meet you! I'm Nathan Hinkle. As I said before, I'm a Human-Centered Design and Development major at Penn State.
                I'm passionate about programming and UX Design! I love working on design-forward projects that
                focus on usability, clarity, and modern tech.
                <br>
                <br>
                My journey into tech and development began very early in my life. From what I can remember, I have always been
                infatuated with it. The biggest stepping stone for me happened in high school. This was when I took my first
                programming course — this is when I knew what I wanted to do. I loved learning different programming languages that let
                me learn more about the tech space I always knew.
                <br>
                <br>
                When I'm not busy working on projects, I spend my time reading, playing games, or just spending time
                with those around me. Some of my other tech-related hobbies include building desktop PCs, as well as developing applications
                that I can use in my everyday life!
